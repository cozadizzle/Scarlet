scarlet -- read ebooks
======================

VERSION 0.01-nightly

## DESCRIPTION

scarlet is a ebook reader for GTK+-systems.

scarlet is being developed with readability as primary focus and is made to be as flexible and usable as the user wishes.

## INSTALLATION

Since scarlet is in VERY early alpha development, you really can't install anything usable.

If you'd like to see how far I've come, feel free to enter the ./src directory and compile the source:

    $ make

Please make sure you've installed the:

* Gtk+-3.0 Development packages
* valac Vala Compiler

## RUNNING

Since there's practically nothing to run, these instructions are for developers only.

Enter the ./bin directory and write

    $ ./scarlet

This will run the main-application

## INSPIRATION

Scarlet is inspired by the [BookWorm](http://danrabbit.deviantart.com/art/BookWorm-239349207) mockup by DanRabbit (at DeviantArt).

## CONTRIBUTE

Feel free to contribute by adding code to the project.
